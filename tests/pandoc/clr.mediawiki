The '''Common Language Runtime''' ('''CLR'''), the [[virtual machine]] component of [[Microsoft|Microsoft's]] [[.NET framework]], manages the execution of .NET programs. [[Just-in-time compilation]] converts the [[managed code]] (compiled [[intermediate language]] code), into [[machine instructions]] which are then executed on the [[CPU]] of the computer.<ref name="msdn-clr">{{cite web| title = Common Language Runtime (CLR) | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bs2ecf4 | accessdate = 14 November 2013 | work = [[MSDN Library]]}}</ref> The CLR provides additional services including [[memory management]], [[type safety]], [[exception handling]], [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], security and [[thread management]]. All programs written for the .NET framework, regardless of [[programming language]], are executed by the CLR. All versions of the .NET framework include CLR. The CLR team was started June 13, 1998.

CLR implements the [[Virtual Execution System]] (VES) as defined in the [[Common Language Infrastructure]] (CLI) standard, initially developed by Microsoft itself. A public standard defines the Common Language Infrastructure specification.<ref>{{cite web | title = ECMA C# and Common Language Infrastructure Standards
